# EthiGive

EthiGive is a blockchain-based charity donation platform developed during the Recurzive national level 24-hour hackathon at Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore. The project aims to bring transparency and efficiency to the process of charitable donations by leveraging blockchain technology.
